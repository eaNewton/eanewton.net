            <div id="main2">I was born in Richardson, TX, but moved to Austin when I was about a year old. I went to college at Texas State University, in San Marcos, TX. Now I'm back in Austin and am building my development skills. Part of the reason programming is so interesting for me is that it requires you to stay on top of what's current in the industry - it's evolving every day and there are always more efficient ways to do the things you did in the past, which is both challenging and rewarding. </div>

            <div id="main2">I'm enrolled in the Java track of courses at ACC, working towards getting the OCA certification. In the meantime, I'm catching up to speed with my HTML/CSS/JavaScript abilities, and studying C# on the side. I learned a bit of jQuery to do some of the transition effects on the pages of this website. Java and C# are  my more proficient languages, but I'm always eager to learn new things.</div>
